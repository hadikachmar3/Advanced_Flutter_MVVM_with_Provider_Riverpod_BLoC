# Course Description

Dive into the depths of **Flutter's MVVM architecture** with different state managements in this comprehensive course designed for intermediate to advanced developers. Learn how to build a dynamic movie app that interacts with a **REST API**, manages local favorites, and incorporates genre mapping for enhanced functionality with **Dark and Light themes**. This course will guide you through the journey of implementing **MVVM** with different state management strategies—**setState**, **Provider**, **Riverpod**, and **BLoC**—each covered in dedicated sections to provide you with a robust understanding of each approach.

## Prerequisites:

- Basic knowledge of programming
- Basic familiarity with **Flutter Widgets** and **Dart**
- Basic understanding of **REST APIs** is a plus, but we cover this in detail
- Enthusiasm for learning state management in-depth
- **Macbook** or **Windows** to develop
- Any preferred **IDE** (such as **Android Studio** or **IntelliJ IDEA**), or a preferred text editor (like **VS Code**)—just not **Microsoft Word**!

## Recording Equipment:

- **Video Editing Software**: **Camtasia 2023**
- **Microphone**: **Blue Yeti X**

This setup ensures that all course videos are clear and professionally produced.

## What You Will Learn:

- Implementing **MVVM architecture** in Flutter for scalable app development
