# Course Description

Dive into the depths of **Flutter's MVVM architecture** with different state managements in this comprehensive course designed for intermediate to advanced developers. Learn how to build a dynamic movie app that interacts with a **REST API**, manages local favorites, and incorporates genre mapping for enhanced functionality with **Dark and Light themes**. This course will guide you through the journey of implementing **MVVM** with different state management strategiesâ€”**setState**, **Provider**, **Riverpod**, and **BLoC**â€”each covered in dedicated sections to provide you with a robust understanding of each approach.

## Prerequisites:

- Basic knowledge of programming
- Basic familiarity with **Flutter Widgets** and **Dart**
- Basic understanding of **REST APIs** is a plus, but we cover this in detail
- Enthusiasm for learning state management in-depth
- **Macbook** or **Windows** to develop
- Any preferred **IDE** (such as **Android Studio** or **IntelliJ IDEA**), or a preferred text editor (like **VS Code**)â€”just not **Microsoft Word**!

## Recording Equipment:

- **Video Editing Software**: **Camtasia 2023**
- **Microphone**: **Blue Yeti X**

This setup ensures that all course videos are clear and professionally produced.

## What You Will Learn:

- Implementing **MVVM architecture** in Flutter for scalable app development
- Connecting to a **REST API** to fetch and display movie data
- Local data management for user favorites
- Advanced state management techniques with **setState**, **Provider**, **Riverpod**, and **BLoC**
- Theme management in Flutter apps for dynamic **light and dark modes**

## Course Structure:

- Duration: Approximately **7 hours** of content
- Regular updates to ensure the latest techniques and Flutter updates are covered

## What to Expect After This Course:

- **Proficiency** in using **MVVM architecture** for complex Flutter applications
- Deep understanding of various **state management techniques** and when to use them
- Skills to design and manage both **themes** and **local databases** in Flutter
- Enhanced capability to handle real-world Flutter projects that require advanced state management and API integration

## Limitations and Notes:

- The course code works for **all platforms supported by Flutter**
- The course project is designed for **portrait mode responsiveness**.
- If you have any other state management in mind, please feel free to propose it so that I can include it in the course

## Resources:
